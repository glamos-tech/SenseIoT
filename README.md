GLAMOS SenseIoT is modular IoT device for fast and easy deployment of professional sensing setup - Low Power, Long Range, multiple sensors, indoor or outdoor.
It allows users to have one master device and multiple sensors devices connected on it. Master device will auto-recognize which sensor devices are connected and will automatically handle sensor device management, message creation and all communication. 

Sensor devices are small devices on which you can connect different sensor with different protocols.

All PCB designs and firmware are open-source.
